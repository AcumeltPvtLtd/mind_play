SECTION 1: TERM DEFINITIONS

Graphite Form (VI, V, IV, III)
The shape classification of graphite, where VI and V are acceptable spheres,
and IV and III are unacceptable irregular or vermicular shapes.

Graphite Size (Code 7)
A standard index number representing the physical diameter of graphite nodules;
Code 7 indicates a fine/small nodule size.

Graphite Distribution
The pattern of how graphite particles are spaced across the metal surface
(e.g., uniform, clustered, or aligned).

Ferrite / Pearlite Ratio
The relative percentage of the metal matrix constituents (excluding graphite)
composed of soft Ferrite versus hard Pearlite.

Graphite Fraction (Area %)
The percentage of the total observed surface area that is physically covered
by graphite carbon.

Particles per mm²
The total density count of all graphite particles (nodular and non-nodular)
in one square millimeter.

Nodular Particles per mm²
The density count of only the graphite particles that meet the roundness
criteria (Forms VI and V) in one square millimeter.

Graphite Nodularity (% by count)
The quality score indicating what percentage of the total graphite particles
are acceptable nodules.

SECTION 2: CALCULATION METHODS & SHORTCUTS

VERIFY FERRITE / PEARLITE RATIO SUM
Formula: Ferrite Ratio % + Pearlite Ratio % = 100%
Demonstration:
55.5 + 44.5 = 100
Mental Check: Look at the decimal points; 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0, making the total whole.

CALCULATE ACTUAL MICROSTRUCTURE % FROM MATRIX RATIO
Formula: (Matrix Ratio % / 100) * (100 - Graphite Fraction %) = Actual Phase %
Demonstration (Finding Actual Ferrite):
100 - 10.3 = 89.7 (This is the Matrix %)
(55.5 / 100) * 89.7 = 49.7835 (Round to 49.8%)
Shortcut: Round Graphite to 10%. Matrix is 90%. 55% of 90 is roughly half of 90 plus a bit (approx 49.5%).

CALCULATE NODULARITY (% BY COUNT)
Formula: (Nodular Particles / Total Particles) * 100 = Nodularity %
Demonstration:
393.81 / 418.17 = 0.9417
0.9417 * 100 = 94.17%
Shortcut: Round to nearest ten. 390 / 420 = 0.928 (approx 93%).

CALCULATE NON-NODULAR GRAPHITE FORMS
Formula: Sum of Bad Forms (IV + III) = Non-Nodular %
Demonstration:
1 + 1 = 2%
Fastest Method: Ignore the big numbers (VI and V); just add the small "bad" percentages found at the end of the list.

FIND UNKNOWN PHASE % (SUM TO 100 TOTAL)
Formula: 100 - Known Phase A - Known Phase B = Unknown Phase C
Demonstration (Given Actual Pearlite = 40% and Graphite = 10.3%):
100 - 40 - 10.3 = 49.7% (This is the Actual Ferrite)
Mental Method: Add the knowns first (40 + 10.3 = 50.3). Subtract that from 100 (100 - 50.3 = 49.7).
