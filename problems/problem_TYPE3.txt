SECTION 1: TERM DEFINITIONS
Graphite Form (VI, V, IV, III): A classification system for graphite shape where VI is perfectly spheroidal, V is slightly irregular, IV is vermicular (worm-like), and III is flake graphite.
Graphite Size (Code 7): A standardized number code where Code 7 indicates the average graphite nodule diameter is between 30 and 40 micrometers.
Graphite Distribution: A description of how the graphite particles are arranged in the matrix, rated as uniform, random, or segregated.
Ferrite / Pearlite Ratio: The proportional area percentages of the ferrite (light, iron-rich) and pearlite (lamellar, Fe3C-containing) phases within the metallic matrix only, excluding graphite.
Graphite Fraction (Area %): The total area percentage of the microstructure occupied by all graphite particles, as opposed to the metallic matrix.
Particles per mm²: The total count of all individual graphite particles observed per square millimeter of the polished sample surface.
Nodular Particles per mm²: The count of only the graphite particles per mm² classified as Form VI or V, which are considered nodular.
Graphite Nodularity (% by count): A quality metric calculated as (Nodular Particles per mm² / Total Particles per mm²) * 100, representing the percentage of graphite particles that are spherical.

SECTION 2: CALCULATION METHODS & SHORTCUTS
Verify the Ferrite/Pearlite ratio sums to 100% of the matrix: From the example ratio (55.5%/44.5%), perform [55.5 + 44.5 = 100.0].
Calculate actual microstructure percentages from ratio and Graphite Fraction: Given matrix ratio (55.5% Ferrite, 44.5% Pearlite) and Graphite Fraction (10.3%).
[Step 1: Matrix % = 100 - 10.3 = 89.7%].
[Step 2: Actual Ferrite % = 89.7 * (55.5 / 100) = 89.7 * 0.555 = 49.78%]. [Actual Pearlite % = 89.7 * (44.5 / 100) = 89.7 * 0.445 = 39.92%].
Shortcut: Round matrix to 90%, then Ferrite ≈ 90 * 0.555 = 49.95%, Pearlite ≈ 90 * 0.445 = 40.05%.
Calculate Nodularity (% by count): Exact calculation from report numbers (393.81 and 418.17) is [393.81 / 418.17 = 0.9417], [0.9417 * 100 = 94.17%]. Shortcut: round to [394 / 418 ≈ 0.942] or 94.2%.
Calculate percentage of non-nodular graphite forms: From report distribution (VI 59%, V 39%, IV 1%, III 1%), non-nodular are IV and III, so [1 + 1 = 2%].
Find unknown phase percentages: Given Pearlite% (entire microstructure) = 40% and Graphite Fraction = 10.3%.
[Step 1: Matrix % = 100 - 10.3 = 89.7%].
[Step 2: Pearlite is part of the matrix, so Ferrite % of entire microstructure = 89.7 - 40 = 49.7%]. Mental check: [100 - 10.3 - 40 = 49.7].
