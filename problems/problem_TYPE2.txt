SECTION 2: CALCULATION METHODS & SHORTCUTS

Verify the Ferrite/Pearlite ratio sums to 100% of the matrix. Show the one-step mental check.
Example: Ferrite (55.5%) + Pearlite (44.5%) = 100%
Mental Check: 55.5 + 44.5 = 100

Calculate the actual microstructure percentages of Ferrite and Pearlite given the Ferrite/Pearlite ratio (55.5%/44.5%) and Graphite Fraction (10.3%). Show the two-step calculation and a rounding shortcut.
Calculation:
Step 1: Calculate matrix percentage: 100% - Graphite Fraction (10.3%) = 89.7% matrix.
Step 2: Calculate actual Ferrite: 89.7% * (55.5% / 100) = 49.79% actual Ferrite.
Step 3: Calculate actual Pearlite: 89.7% * (44.5% / 100) = 39.91% actual Pearlite.
Rounding Shortcut: Round matrix to 90%. Round ratio to 56%/44%. Pearlite = 90 * 0.44 = 39.6%.

Calculate Nodularity (% by count) from "Nodular Particles per mm²" and "Particles per mm²". Show the exact calculation from the report (393.81 and 418.17) and a shortcut for estimating without a calculator.
Exact Calculation:
393.81 / 418.17 * 100 = 94.17%
Shortcut Calculation (Estimation):
Rounding: 394 / 418. Subtract non-nodular count: 418 - 394 = 24. Estimate: 24 / 418 is roughly 24 / 400 = 6%. Nodularity = 100% - 6% = 94%.

Calculate the percentage of non-nodular (non-V/VI) graphite forms from the given Graphite Form distribution (VI 59%, V 39%, IV 1%, III 1%). Show the fastest method.
Calculation: Add the non-nodular forms (IV + III) directly.
1% (Form IV) + 1% (Form III) = 2%

Demonstrate how to find the two unknown phase percentages if only one is known (e.g., given Pearlite% of the entire microstructure is 40%, and Graphite Fraction is 10.3%, find Ferrite%). Show the formula and a quick mental subtraction method.
Calculation:
Formula: Ferrite% = 100% - Pearlite% - Graphite Fraction%
Step 1: Calculate Ferrite percentage: 100% - 40% (Pearlite) - 10.3% (Graphite) = 49.7% Ferrite.
Quick Mental Method: Total (100%) - Pearlite (40%) = 60%. Subtract Graphite (10.3%): 60 - 10.3 = 49.7%.
