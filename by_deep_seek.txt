          CAST IRON MICROSTRUCTURE REPORT - TERMS & DEFINITIONS
=============================================================================

I.  SAMPLE INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Reference
    Definition: Unique identifier for the sample, often linking to a
                production batch, heat number, or purchase order.
    Example: F333-099(BE855)-14

2.  Group
    Definition: Classification of the sample within a set (e.g., A, B, C or
                treatment group). Often left blank for single samples.

3.  Sample Comment
    Definition: General notes about the physical sample (e.g., "as-cast",
                "broken lug", "from riser").

4.  Image Comment
    Definition: Notes specific to the field of view analyzed (e.g., "HUB 821111",
                "center of section", "near defect").
    Example: HUB 821111

5.  Sample Type
    Definition: Indicates the surface preparation of the sample for analysis.
    - Etched: Sample treated with a chemical (e.g., Nital) to reveal the
              metallic matrix (ferrite, pearlite). Used for matrix analysis.
    - Unetched: Sample polished but not etched. Used for graphite analysis.
    Example: 'Etched' for Ferrite/Pearlite analysis; 'Unetched' for Graphite analysis.

6.  Standard
    Definition: The primary international standard used for classification
                and measurement (e.g., ISO, ASTM).
    Example: EN ISO 945-1:2018 (Standard for graphite classification in cast irons).

7.  Standard 2
    Definition: A secondary standard used, often for a specific property like
                nodularity assessment.
    Example: EN ISO 945-1:2018 (again, or could be ASTM A247).

II.  QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS RESULTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.  Particles per mm² (Graphite Particle Count Density)
    Definition: Total number of graphite particles counted per square millimeter
                of the examined area.
    Formula: P_total = (Total Count of Graphite Particles) / (Area of Field in mm²)
    Manual Example: If you count 2500 particles in a field of view that is
                    0.25 mm x 0.25 mm = 0.0625 mm², then:
                    P_total = 2500 / 0.0625 = 40,000 particles/mm².
    Report Example: 418.17 particles/mm².

9.  Graphite Form (Type/Shape)
    Definition: Classification of graphite particles by shape according to
                standards like ISO 945-1. Reported as % distribution of forms.
    Common Forms:
        I    Lamellar (Flake)
        II   ? (Rarely used in common reports)
        III  Compacted/Vermicular
        IV   Nodular (Spheroidal, but imperfect)
        V    Irregular
        VI   Perfect Nodular (Spheroidal)
    How it's done: An operator or software classifies each particle by comparing
                   its shape to standard charts. Results are tallied into percentages.
    Manual Example: You classify 100 particles: 60 as Form VI, 35 as Form V,
                    4 as Form IV, 1 as Form III.
                    Calculation:
                    Form VI% = (60/100)*100 = 60%
                    Form V%  = (35/100)*100 = 35%
                    Form IV% = (4/100)*100  = 4%
                    Form III%= (1/100)*100  = 1%
    Report Example: VI(59%) V(39%) IV(1%) III(1%)

10. Graphite Size
    Definition: A number representing the average size of the graphite particles,
                often corresponding to a chart in the standard (e.g., ISO 945-1).
                A lower number means finer graphite.
    Common Scale: Typically 1 (very coarse) to 8 (very fine).
    How it's done: The area of each particle is measured, converted to an
                   equivalent circle diameter. The mean or median of these
                   diameters is then matched to the standard chart number.
    Report Example: 7 (indicating fine graphite).

11. Graphite Distribution
    Definition: Describes the spatial uniformity of graphite particles
                (e.g., "Uniform", "Random", "Segregated", "Eutectic Cell").
    Note: Often left blank or implied in automated reports.

12. Ferrite / Pearlite Ratio
    Definition: The area percentage of the metallic matrix (iron) comprised of
                ferrite (soft, light etching phase) and pearlite (harder,
                lamellar phase of ferrite + cementite). Does NOT include graphite.
    Key Point: Ratio is of the MATRIX ONLY. Graphite is separate.
    Formula: %Ferrite + %Pearlite = 100% of the matrix area.
    How it's done: On an ETCHED sample, image analysis software or point counting
                   determines the area fraction of each phase in the matrix.
    Manual Example (Point Counting): On a 100-point grid over the matrix (avoiding
                   graphite), 60 points land on ferrite, 40 on pearlite.
                   %Ferrite = (60/100)*100 = 60%
                   %Pearlite = (40/100)*100 = 40%
    Report Example: 55.5% / 44.5%

13. Graphite Fraction (aka Graphite Area Fraction, %Graphite)
    Definition: The total area percentage of the ENTIRE microstructure (matrix +
                graphite) occupied by graphite particles.
    Formula: %G = (Total Graphite Area / Total Image Area) * 100
    Manual Example: In a 1000x1000 pixel image, if thresholding shows 103,000
                    pixels are graphite, then:
                    %G = (103,000 / 1,000,000) * 100 = 10.3%
    Report Example: 10.3 % (This value is typically from the unetched analysis).

14. Nodular Particles per mm²
    Definition: The number of graphite particles classified as "nodular"
                (typically Forms IV and VI) per square millimeter.
    Formula: P_nodular = (Count of Nodular Particles) / (Area of Field in mm²)
    Relationship: P_nodular <= Particles per mm².
    Manual Example: From the 2500 particles counted earlier, suppose 2350 were
                    Forms IV & VI. Area was 0.0625 mm².
                    P_nodular = 2350 / 0.0625 = 37,600 particles/mm².
    Report Example: 393.81 nodular particles/mm².

15. Graphite Nodularity
    Definition: The percentage, by particle COUNT, of graphite particles that
                are nodular (Forms IV & VI) relative to the total number of
                graphite particles.
    Formula: %Nod = [ (Count of Form IV + Count of Form VI) / (Total Graphite Count) ] * 100
    Key Point: It is a COUNT-based percentage, NOT an area-based percentage.
    Manual Example: Total particles = 100. Form VI = 59, Form IV = 1.
                    Nodular Particles = 59 + 1 = 60.
                    %Nod = (60 / 100) * 100 = 60%
    Report Example: 94.0 % by count.
    Calculation from Report Data (Cross-Check):
        Total Particles/mm² = 418.17
        Nodular Particles/mm² = 393.81
        Implied Nodularity = (393.81 / 418.17) * 100 ≈ 94.2% (Matches 94.0% with rounding).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRACTICAL WALKTHROUGH: DECODING THE EXAMPLE REPORT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The report shows TWO analyses on the SAME sample (F333-099(BE855)-14):
**Part 1 (Etched Sample):**
    Purpose: Analyze the metallic matrix.
    Results: Ferrite/Pearlite Ratio = 55.5%/44.5%, Graphite Fraction = 10.3%.
    Note: Graphite data here may be a carry-over or from a linked dataset.

**Part 2 (Unetched Sample):**
    Purpose: Analyze the graphite particles.
    Results:
    - Standard used: EN ISO 945-1:2018.
    - Particle Density: 418.17 part./mm².
    - Graphite Form: Mostly Forms VI & V (59% + 39% = 98%).
    - Graphite Size: 7 (Fine).
    - Graphite Fraction: 10.3% (Links result from Part 1).
    - Nodular Particle Density: 393.81 part./mm².
    - Nodularity: 94.0% (Calculated as 393.81 / 418.17).

Interpretation: This is a high-quality ductile iron (nodular graphite iron).
- High nodularity (94%) indicates excellent spheroidization treatment.
- Fine graphite size (7) is typical for well-inoculated castings.
- The matrix is slightly ferrite-rich (55.5%), which provides good ductility.
- Graphite fraction of 10.3% is within typical range for ductile iron.

ASCII CHEAT SHEET - KEY FORMULAS & RELATIONSHIPS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  %Ferrite + %Pearlite = 100% (of the matrix area)
2.  %Graphite + %Matrix = 100% (of the total microstructure area)
3.  Nodularity (% by count) = (Nodular Particles / Total Particles) * 100
4.  Any "per mm²" value = (Count) / (Microscope Field Area in mm²)
5.  Graphite Form % for a type = (Count of that Form / Total Particles) * 100

REMEMBER:
- "Etched" -> Look at FERRITE/PEARLITE.
- "Unetched" -> Look at GRAPHITE shape, size, nodularity.
- Nodularity is a COUNT ratio. Graphite Fraction is an AREA ratio.
