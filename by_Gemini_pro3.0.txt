================================================================================

This document breaks down the "Cast Iron Analysis" machine report. It explains 
the terms, the math behind the numbers, and provides a "Mental Math" example 
using a small sample size (20-35 items) to make it easy to understand.

PART 2: DETAILED TERMS & MATH FORMULAS
================================================================================

1. GRAPHITE FORM (ISO 945-1)
   -------------------------
   Machines classify every black spot into a Roman Numeral bucket.
   * Form VI (6): Perfect Nodules.
   * Form V  (5): Slightly irregular Nodules.
   * Form IV (4): Stubby worms.
   * Form III(3): Worms (Vermicular).
   * Form I  (1): Flakes (Grey Iron).

2. NODULARITY (%)
   --------------
   This is the most important number for Ductile Iron.
   
   FORMULA (By Count):
   Nodularity = ( (Count of Form VI + Count of Form V) / Total Count ) * 100
   
   * Note: Some standards weight this by area, but "By Count" is the 
     fundamental logic.

3. PARTICLES PER mm2 (Density)
   ---------------------------
   FORMULA:
   Density = Total Number of Particles Counted / Area of Image (in mm2)

4. FERRITE / PEARLITE RATIO
   ------------------------
   Only visible when "Etched".
   
   FORMULA:
   Ferrite %  = (Area of White Region / Total Matrix Area) * 100
   Pearlite % = (Area of Dark Region  / Total Matrix Area) * 100
   
   * Note: Ferrite + Pearlite + Carbides usually = 100%

================================================================================
PART 3: PRACTICAL STUDY EXAMPLE (THE 20-35 COUNT)
================================================================================

Let's simulate how the machine thinks using a human-friendly example.
Imagine you are looking at a very small zoomed-in photo.

SCENARIO:
You have a photo that represents exactly 0.1 mm2 of actual metal.
You count the black spots on this photo manually.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP A: COUNTING AND CLASSIFYING (Raw Data)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You look at the photo and count a total of 34 spots (Your "Total Count").
You judge their shapes:

1. Perfect Spheres (Form VI)  : 20 spots
2. Bumpy Spheres   (Form V)   : 12 spots
3. Long Worms      (Form III) :  2 spots
   -------------------------------------
   TOTAL                      : 34 spots

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP B: CALCULATING NODULARITY (The Math)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Objective: Find the "Nodularity %"

Logic: "Good" particles are Form VI and Form V.
       "Bad" particles are Form I, II, III.

Known Values:
- Good Count (VI + V) = 20 + 12 = 32
- Total Count         = 34

The Math:
Nodularity = (32 / 34) * 100

Mental Math Trick:
32 is almost 34. 
Difference is 2. 
2 out of 34 is roughly 6% (since 1/34 is ~3%).
So, 100% - 6% = 94%.

Result: 94.1% Nodularity. 
(This matches the logic in your report where it says "94.0% by count").

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP C: CALCULATING PARTICLES PER mm2 (The Density)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Objective: Find the "Particles per mm2"

Known Values:
- Total Count = 34
- Area Looked at = 0.1 mm2 (Given in our scenario)

The Math:
Density = Count / Area
Density = 34 / 0.1

Calculation:
34 divided by one-tenth is the same as 34 * 10.

Result: 340 Particles per mm2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP D: CALCULATING GRAPHITE FORM DISTRIBUTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Objective: Percentages for each shape (VI, V, etc.)

Math: (Specific Shape Count / Total Count) * 100

- Form VI % = (20 / 34) * 100 = 58.8%  (Round to 59%)
- Form V %  = (12 / 34) * 100 = 35.2%  (Round to 35%)
- Form III %= ( 2 / 34) * 100 =  5.8%  (Round to 6%)

Result for Report: VI(59%) V(35%) III(6%)

================================================================================
PART 4: DECODING YOUR SPECIFIC REPORT
================================================================================

Here is how to apply the knowledge above to the specific lines in your report:

REPORT LINE: "Ferrite / Pearlite Ratio: 55.5% / 44.5%"
--> ANALYSIS:
    Sample was Etched.
    The machine looked at the background.
    It saw slightly more White (Ferrite) than Dark (Pearlite).
    This implies the metal is Ductile Iron Grade 65-45-12 or similar.
    It is machineable (soft enough) but strong.

REPORT LINE: "Graphite Form: VI(59%) V(39%) IV(1%) III(1%)"
--> ANALYSIS:
    Sample was Unetched.
    The machine counted thousands of spots.
    59% were Perfect Spheres.
    39% were Imperfect Spheres.
    Total "Good" Graphite = 59 + 39 = 98%.
    This is extremely high quality casting.

REPORT LINE: "Particles per mm2: 418.17"
--> ANALYSIS:
    This is a high number. High particle count usually means:
    1. The iron solidified quickly.
    2. The metal is stronger and less prone to cracking.
    (Low counts like <100 might mean the iron is weaker).

REPORT LINE: "Graphite Fraction: 10.3%"
--> ANALYSIS:
    If you melted the iron down, roughly 10% of the volume is pure Carbon.
    The rest is Iron, Silicon, etc.

================================================================================
PART 5: SOLVING FOR UNKNOWNS (ALGEBRA HELP)
================================================================================

If your report has a smudge and you can't read a number, you can calculate it.

CASE 1: YOU KNOW FERRITE, BUT PEARLITE IS MISSING
Formula: Pearlite = 100% - Ferrite% - (Carbides/Other)
Example: Ferrite is 55.5%.
Missing Pearlite = 100 - 55.5 = 44.5%.

CASE 2: YOU KNOW NODULARITY % AND TOTAL COUNT, BUT NOT "GOOD" COUNT
Formula: Good Count = (Nodularity / 100) * Total Count
Example: 
  Nodularity = 94%
  Total Particles = 418
  How many are spherical?
  Calculation: 0.94 * 418 = 392.9 (Round to 393 Nodular Particles).
  *Check your report: It lists "Nodular Particles per mm2: 393.81". It matches!*
